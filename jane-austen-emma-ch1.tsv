Woodhouse	O
handsome	O
clever	O
and	O
rich	O
with	O
a	O
comfortable	O
home	O
and	O
happy	O

seemed	O
to	O
unite	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
blessings	O
of	O
existence	O
and	O
had	O
lived	O
nearly	O
twenty	O
one	O
years	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
with	O
very	O
little	O
to	O
distress	O
or	O
vex	O
her	O
She	O
was	O
the	O
youngest	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
daughters	O
of	O
a	O
most	O
affectionate	O
indulgent	O
father	O
and	O
had	O
in	O
consequence	O
of	O
her	O
sister	O
's	O

been	O
mistress	O
of	O
his	O
house	O
from	O
a	O
very	O
early	O
period	O
Her	O
mother	O
had	O
died	O
too	O
long	O
ago	O
for	O
her	O
to	O
have	O
more	O
than	O
an	O
indistinct	O
remembrance	O
of	O
her	O
caresses	O
and	O
her	O
place	O
had	O
been	O
supplied	O
by	O
an	O
excellent	O
woman	O
as	O
governess	O
who	O
had	O
fallen	O
little	O
short	O
of	O
a	O

in	O
affection	O
Sixteen	O
years	O
had	O
Miss	O
Taylor	O
been	O
in	O
Mr	O
Woodhouse	O
's	O
family	O
less	O
as	O
a	O
governess	O
than	O
a	O
friend	O
very	O
fond	O
of	O
both	O
daughters	O
but	O
particularly	O
of	O
Emma	O
Between	O
them	O
it	O
was	O
more	O
the	O
intimacy	O
of	O
sisters	O
Even	O
before	O
Miss	O
Taylor	O
had	O
ceased	O
to	O
hold	O
the	O
nominal	O
office	O
of	O
governess	O
the	O
mildness	O
of	O
her	O
temper	O
had	O
hardly	O
allowed	O
her	O
to	O
impose	O
any	O
restraint	O
and	O
the	O
shadow	O
of	O
authority	O
being	O
now	O
long	O
passed	O
away	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
living	O
together	O
as	O
friend	O
and	O
friend	O
very	O
mutually	O
attached	O
and	O
Emma	O
doing	O
just	O
what	O
she	O
liked	O
highly	O
esteeming	O
Miss	O
Taylor	O
's	O
judgment	O
but	O
directed	O
chiefly	O
by	O
her	O
own	O
The	O
real	O
evils	O
indeed	O
of	O
Emma	O
's	O
situation	O
were	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
having	O
rather	O
too	O
much	O
her	O
own	O
way	O
and	O
a	O
disposition	O
to	O
think	O
a	O
little	O
too	O
well	O
of	O
herself	O
these	O
were	O
the	O
disadvantages	O
which	O
threatened	O
alloy	O
to	O
her	O
many	O
enjoyments	O
The	O
danger	O
however	O
was	O
at	O

brought	O
grief	O
It	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
wedding	O
day	O
of	O
this	O

that	O
Emma	O
first	O
sat	O
in	O

The	O

of	O
a	O

a	O
long	O

Her	O

composed	O
himself	O
to	O
sleep	O
after	O
dinner	O
as	O
usual	O
and	O
she	O
had	O
then	O
only	O
to	O
sit	O
and	O
think	O
of	O
what	O
she	O
had	O
lost	O
The	O
event	O

every	O
promise	O
of	O

a	O
man	O
of	O
unexceptionable	O
character	O
easy	O
fortune	O
suitable	O
age	O
and	O
pleasant	O
manners	O
and	O
there	O
was	O
some	O
satisfaction	O
in	O
considering	O
with	O
what	O
self	O
denying	O
generous	O
friendship	O
she	O
had	O
always	O
wished	O
and	O
promoted	O
the	O
match	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
black	O
morning	O
's	O
work	O
for	O
her	O
The	O
want	O
of	O
Miss	O
Taylor	O
would	O
be	O
felt	O
every	O
hour	O
of	O
every	O

She	O

of	O
sixteen	O

how	O
she	O

with	O

from	O
five	O

A	O

It	O

that	O

James	O

You	O

And	O
as	O
for	O
James	O
you	O
may	O
be	O
very	O
sure	O
he	O
will	O
always	O
like	O
going	O
to	O
Randalls	O
because	O
of	O
his	O
daughter	O

there	O
I	O
only	O
doubt	O
whether	O
he	O
will	O
ever	O
take	O
us	O
anywhere	O
else	O
That	O
was	O
your	O
doing	O
papa	O
You	O
got	O
Hannah	O
that	O
good	O
place	O
Nobody	O
thought	O
of	O
Hannah	O
till	O
you	O
mentioned	O
her	O
James	O
is	O
so	O
obliged	O
to	O
you	O
I	O
am	O
very	O
glad	O
I	O
did	O
think	O
of	O
her	O
It	O
was	O
very	O
lucky	O
for	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
had	O
poor	O
James	O
think	O
himself	O
slighted	O
upon	O
any	O
account	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
sure	O
she	O
will	O
make	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
servant	O
she	O
is	O
a	O
civil	O
pretty	O
spoken	O
girl	O
I	O
have	O
a	O
great	O
opinion	O
of	O
her	O
Whenever	O
I	O
see	O
her	O
she	O
always	O
curtseys	O
and	O
asks	O
me	O
how	O
I	O
do	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
pretty	O
manner	O
and	O
when	O
you	O
have	O
had	O
her	O
here	O
to	O
do	O
needlework	O
I	O
observe	O
she	O
always	O
turns	O
the	O
lock	O
of	O
the	O
door	O
the	O
right	O
way	O
and	O
never	O
bangs	O
it	O
I	O
am	O
sure	O
she	O
will	O
be	O
an	O
excellent	O
servant	O
and	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
a	O
great	O
comfort	O
to	O
poor	O
Miss	O
Taylor	O
to	O
have	O
somebody	O
about	O
her	O
that	O
she	O
is	O
used	O
to	O
see	O
Whenever	O
James	O
goes	O
over	O
to	O
see	O
his	O
daughter	O
you	O
know	O
she	O
will	O
be	O

will	O
be	O

her	O
how	O

about	O
a	O

was	O
a	O
frequent	O
visitor	O
and	O

at	O
this	O

walked	O
up	O

Mr	O

for	O
some	O
time	O
Mr	O
Knightley	O
had	O
a	O
cheerful	O
manner	O
which	O
always	O
did	O
him	O
good	O
and	O
his	O
many	O
inquiries	O
after	O
poor	O

When	O
this	O

observed	O
It	O
is	O
very	O
kind	O
of	O
you	O
Mr	O

to	O
come	O
out	O
at	O
this	O
late	O
hour	O
to	O
call	O
upon	O
us	O
I	O
am	O
afraid	O
you	O
must	O
have	O
had	O
a	O
shocking	O
walk	O
Not	O
at	O
all	O
sir	O
It	O
is	O
a	O
beautiful	O
moonlight	O
night	O
and	O
so	O
mild	O
that	O
I	O
must	O
draw	O
back	O
from	O
your	O
great	O
fire	O
But	O
you	O
must	O
have	O
found	O
it	O
very	O
damp	O
and	O
dirty	O
I	O
wish	O
you	O
may	O
not	O

Look	O
at	O
my	O
shoes	O
Not	O
a	O
speck	O
on	O

Well	O
that	O
is	O
quite	O
surprising	O
for	O
we	O
have	O
had	O
a	O
vast	O
deal	O
of	O
rain	O
here	O
It	O
rained	O
dreadfully	O
hard	O
for	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
at	O
breakfast	O
I	O
wanted	O
them	O
to	O
put	O
off	O
the	O

By	O
the	O

I	O

not	O

Ah	O
poor	O
Miss	O

Tis	O
a	O
sad	O
business	O
Poor	O
Mr	O
and	O
Miss	O
Woodhouse	O
if	O
you	O

but	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
possibly	O
say	O
poor	O
Miss	O
Taylor	O
I	O
have	O
a	O
great	O
regard	O
for	O
you	O
and	O
Emma	O
but	O
when	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
the	O
question	O
of	O
dependence	O
or	O
independence	O
At	O
any	O

it	O
must	O
be	O
better	O
to	O
have	O
only	O
one	O
to	O

than	O
two	O

when	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
two	O
is	O
such	O
a	O
fanciful	O
troublesome	O
creature	O
said	O
Emma	O
playfully	O
That	O
is	O
what	O
you	O
have	O
in	O
your	O
head	O
I	O
know	O
and	O
what	O
you	O
would	O
certainly	O
say	O
if	O
my	O
father	O
were	O
not	O
by	O
I	O
believe	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
true	O
my	O
dear	O
indeed	O
said	O
Mr	O
Woodhouse	O
with	O
a	O
sigh	O
I	O
am	O
afraid	O
I	O
am	O
sometimes	O
very	O
fanciful	O
and	O
troublesome	O
My	O

You	O
do	O
not	O

I	O
could	O

you	O
or	O

Mr	O
Knightley	O
to	O

you	O
What	O
a	O
horrible	O
idea	O
Oh	O
no	O
I	O

Mr	O

you	O

in	O
a	O

it	O

all	O
a	O

We	O
always	O

Mr	O
Knightley	O
in	O
fact	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
few	O
people	O
who	O
could	O
see	O
faults	O
in	O
Emma	O
Woodhouse	O
and	O
the	O
only	O
one	O
who	O
ever	O
told	O
her	O
of	O
them	O
and	O
though	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
particularly	O
agreeable	O
to	O
Emma	O
herself	O
she	O
knew	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
so	O
much	O
less	O
so	O
to	O
her	O
father	O
that	O
she	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
him	O
really	O
suspect	O
such	O
a	O
circumstance	O
as	O
her	O
not	O
being	O
thought	O
perfect	O
by	O
every	O
body	O
Emma	O
knows	O
I	O
never	O
flatter	O
her	O
said	O
Mr	O
Knightley	O
but	O
I	O
meant	O
no	O
reflection	O
on	O
any	O
body	O
Miss	O
Taylor	O

to	O
have	O

Emma	O
willing	O
to	O
let	O
it	O
pass	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
hear	O
about	O
the	O
wedding	O
and	O
I	O
shall	O
be	O
happy	O
to	O
tell	O
you	O
for	O
we	O
all	O
behaved	O
charmingly	O
Every	O
body	O
was	O
punctual	O
every	O

in	O
their	O

hardly	O
a	O

Oh	O
no	O
we	O

felt	O
that	O
we	O

only	O
half	O
a	O

were	O

Dear	O
Emma	O

every	O

so	O

her	O

Mr	O
Knightley	O
she	O
is	O
really	O
very	O
sorry	O
to	O
lose	O
poor	O
Miss	O
Taylor	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
sure	O
she	O
will	O
miss	O
her	O
more	O
than	O
she	O

for	O
Emma	O
turned	O
away	O
her	O

It	O
is	O
impossible	O
that	O
Emma	O
should	O
not	O
miss	O
such	O
a	O
companion	O
said	O
Mr	O
Knightley	O
We	O
should	O
not	O
like	O
her	O
so	O
well	O
as	O
we	O
do	O
sir	O
if	O
we	O
could	O

the	O

is	O
to	O
Miss	O

Every	O

Mr	O

her	O
Her	O

Ah	O
my	O

I	O

indeed	O
for	O

It	O
is	O
the	O

amusement	O
in	O
the	O

And	O
after	O
such	O
success	O
you	O

Every	O

that	O
Mr	O

would	O
never	O

again	O
Oh	O
dear	O
no	O
Mr	O
Weston	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
a	O

and	O
who	O

without	O

Mr	O

alone	O
if	O
he	O
did	O
not	O

it	O
Oh	O
no	O
Mr	O
Weston	O
certainly	O
would	O
never	O

Some	O

since	O
the	O
day	O
about	O
four	O
years	O

that	O
Miss	O
Taylor	O

I	O
met	O
with	O
him	O
in	O
Broadway	O

when	O
because	O
it	O
began	O
to	O

he	O
darted	O
away	O
with	O

gallantry	O
and	O
borrowed	O
two	O
umbrellas	O
for	O
us	O
from	O
Farmer	O

I	O
made	O
up	O
my	O

the	O

from	O
that	O

what	O
you	O

Success	O
supposes	O

Your	O

rather	O

only	O
your	O

your	O

thing	O
for	O
